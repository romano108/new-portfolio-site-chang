          Hey guys, my name is Andoni Romano, and I'm a front-end developer with
          three years of professional experience. I love building components,
          applicationsâ€”you name it. I enjoy every step of the process.
        </p>
        <p className="text-start text-muted-foreground lg:px-6">
          I'm also passionate about music, chess, books, and traveling. I
          specialize in building high-performance, accessible, and user-friendly
          interfaces using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue, Next.js, Web
          Components, Stencil, amongst others. Currently, I'm learning more
          backend development, libraries like GSAP, and AI agents.
        </p>
        <p className="text-start text-muted-foreground lg:px-6">
          I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with UI/UX
          designers and cross-functional teams in Agile settings to deliver
          seamless user experiences through clean, efficient code.
